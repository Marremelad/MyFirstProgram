# MyFirstProgram

### Description
This is an improved version of the very first assignment we got from school. Check out the branch named "original" to see the first implementation.

### Features

* Pick a number and compare it to the number 10
* Input a name and get a response 
* Count from 1 to whatever number has been chosen 

Keep in mind that the program counts in actual seconds. If happen you pick a number that tests your patience you can always exit the program by typing **ctrl + c**
